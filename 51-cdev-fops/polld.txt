polld
=====

Implements a polling method for a character device. The module creates up 4 (configurable up to 10)
character devices, with device nodes named /dev/polld*.

These 'devices' become available at different intervals (device 0 - 1 sec, device 2 - 2 secs, etc.)

The test program test/t_polld calls select() at 1/8 second intervals to see if a device
can be read from. The program then reads from devices that have become available (each device
just supplies its number in the output buffer). The test program outputs the numbers of devices just read
and proceeds to the next wait, i.e. select() call.
