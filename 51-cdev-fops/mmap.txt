mmap
====

The module implements the mmap() file operation on a character device. The module creates
the /dev/mmap device node that the test program can access (either as root, or as normal
user if UDEV rules are added).

On request from userspace (i.e. an mmap() system call), the module maps its internal
kernel memory buffer to userspace pages that are visible to the calling userspace process.
Thus, changes made by kernel/userspace become immediately visible by the other party.

The test program (test/t_mmap) first calls mmap() on the device file, then opens it for
read and performs a regular read to a buffer. The buffer contents are then compared
to the mmap'ed memory. Next, the test program overwrites the mmap'ed memory with 
ABCDEF... character sequences and then does a regular read on the device again.
The result of the second read is matched against the contents of the buffer.
