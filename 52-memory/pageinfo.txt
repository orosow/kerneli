pageinfo 
========

provides an ioctl to obtain raw page table info related to a given virtual address.
The module walks the process's page tables starting at current->mm->pgd (equivalent to CR3 CPU register),
it then obtains the access flags directly from the related PTE (Page Table Entry)

the test program is test/t_pageinfo

A sample run (-cd stands for code & data segment) gives the following results:

./t_pageinfo -cd
======== CODE SEGMENT ===========
virtual address: 40079b -- size: 4 KB   PRES glob dirt ACC  writ EXEC huge :: flags: 0x25 :: physical page address: ba8a2000
====== DATA SEGMENT =========
virtual address: 601468 -- size: 4 KB   PRES glob DIRT ACC  WRIT exec huge :: flags: 0x8000000000000067 :: physical page address: b5ada000
