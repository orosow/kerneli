kthreadwq
=========

This module runs a kernel thread and a timer. The threads puts itself to sleep (on a wait queue) until
it is told to stop or is woken up by the timer function. The timer fires at 5 sec intervals (configurable
module parameter) and wakes up the waiting thread, which, in turn, prints a message and clears
the 'data-ready' flag.

The thread stops printing until (configurable) 5 iterations, but continues to run until the module is unloaded.
